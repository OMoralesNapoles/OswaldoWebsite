      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Oswaldo Morales Nápoles is associate professor of probabilistic design. He holds an MSc and PhD in applied mathematics both from Delft University of Technology. His research group is at the intersection of probability and statistics, domain knowledge (civil engineering) and software development. His research group develops Matlab and Python based open source software for Bayesian Belief Networks (BANSHEE & MATLATZINCA), structured expert judgment (ANDURIL) and other tools for representing multidimensional probability distributions (CHIMERA). Application of these tools include mechanics of materials, steel and concrete bridge reliability, earth dams risk analysis, infrastructure network maintenance optimization, flood risk assessment and others. He is Global Community Professor at Universidad de Monterrey in Monterrey Mexico since 2024 and head of the section Hydraulic Structures and Flood Risks at the TU Delft since July 2023.
